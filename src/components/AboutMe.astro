			🌟 <strong>Shreyan</strong> (but you can call me Shrey) – a name that echoes curiosity, versatility, and a love for all things extraordinary. From engineering blockchain sequencers overnight (with zero prior knowledge!) to mastering every corner of computer science, I’ve turned “learning on the go” into my personal superpower.
		</p>
		<p>
			🚀 Be it web development, AI & ML, data analytics, design, or pioneering the future of Web3, I’ve explored it all. Each project, whether it’s groundbreaking research or dynamic collaborations with industry leaders, fuels my drive to innovate and push boundaries.
		</p>
		<p>
			🎓 With a <strong>BTech in CSE from IIIT Raipur</strong> and currently pursuing my <strong>MTech in CSE at NITK Surathkal</strong>, I’m on a relentless journey to not just learn but thrive. My mantra? Be better every day—because excellence isn’t just a goal; it’s a way of life.
		</p>
		<p>
			But hey, it’s not all about tech. 🎸 I’m a guitar-strumming, adventure-seeking soul who loves exploring the world, chasing sunsets, and living life to its fullest.
		</p>
		<p>
			Let’s build the future together—one innovative idea and one unforgettable adventure at a time. 💻✨
